# Historical NVIC Audit - Bramble RP2040 Emulator

**Date:** December 6, 2025
**Re-verified:** September 8, 2026 (codebase past v0.50.0, 385/385 tests)
**Status:** ✅ **HISTORICAL AUDIT - ALL 3 ISSUES RESOLVED AND RE-VERIFIED**

---

> This document is preserved for historical context. The three issues identified here
> were fixed in later releases: NVIC MMIO routing, priority-aware scheduling, and
> exception return handling are all implemented in the current codebase.
>
> Current regression coverage also exercises 8/16/32-bit NVIC and SCB MMIO access,
> SVCall and HardFault delivery, nested exception unwind, and ARMv6-M lockup behavior.

## Executive Summary

Your NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller) implementation is **well-designed and properly integrated** throughout the codebase. The core functionality is sound, following ARM Cortex-M0+ specifications accurately.

**Audit Results:** 3 actionable issues were identified in December 2025 and have since been fixed.

---

## ✅ What's Working Well

### 1. **Core NVIC Structure & State Management**
- ✅ Proper `nvic_state_t` structure with all required registers
- ✅ Correct interrupt enable/disable (ISER/ICER)
- ✅ Pending interrupt tracking (ISPR/ICPR)
- ✅ Priority register implementation (8-bit per IRQ, bits [7:6] used)
- ✅ Active exception tracking via `active_exceptions` bitmask

### 2. **CPU Integration**
- ✅ **Interrupt detection timing:** Before instruction execution in `cpu_step()`
- ✅ **Exception entry implementation:** Textbook-correct with:
  - Context stacking (R0-R3, R12, LR, PC, xPSR)
  - ISR handler address lookup from vector table
  - Stack frame creation (32 bytes for M0+)
  - Return address setup (0xFFFFFFF9)
  - Active bit management

### 3. **Peripheral Integration**
- ✅ **Timer → NVIC pathway:** `nvic_signal_irq()` called on alarm fire
- ✅ **Correct signaling pattern:** Reusable for other peripherals
- ✅ **Debug output:** Comprehensive state change logging

### 4. **Register Access Handling**
- ✅ NVIC register read/write logic correct
- ✅ SCB_ICSR returns proper vector pending bits
- ✅ SCB_VTOR correctly returns flash base

### 5. **Cortex-M0+ Compliance**
- ✅ 4-level priority support (bits [7:6])
- ✅ 26 RP2040 external IRQs defined
- ✅ Exception definitions (NMI, HardFault, SysTick, PendSV, SVCall)

## ⚠️ Issues Requiring Fixes

### **ISSUE #1: NVIC Memory Bus Routing** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Location:** `src/membus.c`
**Status:** ✅ FIXED & RE-VERIFIED 2026-09-08 — `0xE000E000` range routed in all `mem_*` functions (incl. 8/16-bit paths per the header note)
**Severity:** ~~CRITICAL~~ resolved  
**Time to Fix:** 30-45 minutes  
**Lines of Code:** ~50 lines  

**Problem:**
```c
/* NVIC_BASE (0xE000E000) range is NOT routed in memory bus */
uint32_t mem_read32(uint32_t addr) {
    // ... FLASH, RAM, GPIO, TIMER handled ...
    // ... but NOT NVIC registers ...
    return 0;  /* Silent failure */
}
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Firmware cannot enable interrupts: `*(uint32_t*)0xE000E100 = 1;` does nothing
- ❌ Cannot set priorities via IPR registers
- ✅ BUT: Programmatic API works (timer calls `nvic_signal_irq()` directly)

**Solution:** Route 0xE000E000-0xE000EFFF range to NVIC module in all 5 mem_* functions

### **ISSUE #2: Interrupt Priority Scheduling** 🟡 IMPORTANT

**Location:** `src/nvic.c`, function `nvic_get_pending_irq()`
**Status:** ✅ FIXED & RE-VERIFIED 2026-09-08 — priority-aware selection implemented; IPR reads/writes masked to `0xC0` (`src/nvic.c`)
**Severity:** ~~IMPORTANT~~ resolved  
**Time to Fix:** 1 hour  
**Lines of Code:** ~30 lines  

**Problem:**
```c
/* Returns LOWEST IRQ number, not HIGHEST priority */
uint32_t nvic_get_pending_irq(void) {
    for (uint32_t irq = 0; irq < NUM_EXTERNAL_IRQS; irq++) {
        if (pending_and_enabled & (1 << irq)) {
            return irq;  /* WRONG: should check priority[irq] */
        }
    }
}
```

**Real-World Failure Scenario:**
```
IRQ 3:  pending, priority=0xC0 (level 3, LOWEST)
IRQ 8:  pending, priority=0x00 (level 0, HIGHEST)

Current: Returns 3 (lowest number) ❌
Correct: Should return 8 (lower numeric priority) ✅

Result: Low-priority task executes first → MISSED DEADLINE
```

**Why ARM Uses This:** Lower numeric = higher priority (standard in ARM/MIPS)

**Solution:** Implement priority-aware search comparing `priority[irq] & 0xC0` values

### **ISSUE #3: Exception Return Not Implemented** 🟡 IMPORTANT

**Location:** `src/cpu.c`, `src/instructions.c`
**Status:** ✅ FIXED & RE-VERIFIED 2026-09-08 — `cpu_exception_return()` handles magic LR; SVCall/HardFault delivery + nested unwind covered by regression tests
**Severity:** ~~IMPORTANT~~ resolved  
**Time to Fix:** 1.5 hours  
**Lines of Code:** ~50 lines  

**Problem:**
```c
/* No handler for magic LR values (0xFFFFFFF9) */
void instr_bx(uint16_t instr) {
    uint32_t target = cpu.r[rm];
    cpu.r[15] = target & ~1;  /* Jumps to 0xFFFFFFF9 - invalid address! */
}
```

**Expected Behavior:** When BX LR executed with LR=0xFFFFFFF9:
1. Pop 32-byte context frame from stack
2. Restore R0-R3, R12, PC, xPSR, SP
3. Clear active exception bit
4. Return to interrupted code

**Current Behavior:** Jumps to invalid address 0xFFFFFFF9 → CPU halts

**Impact:**
- ❌ ISRs cannot return to interrupted code
- ❌ Cannot support nested interrupts
- ❌ Cannot preserve register context

**Solution:** Add `cpu_exception_return()` handler in `instr_bx()` for magic values
